# ARP_Spoofing
This repository will focus on my minor project ARP Spoofing and mitm attack report.

This Project is a mainly focused on the layer 2 protocol ARP(Address Resolution Protocol).

# Address Resolution Protocol

Address resolution refers to the process of dynamically finding the Media Access
Control (MAC) address of a computer on a network. The Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) thus provides a dynamic mapping between the two different forms
of addresses: the 32- bit Internet Protocol (IP) address and the 48-bit MAC address
that the data link layer uses . In shorts the ARP protocol is used to mapping IP
Address to MAC (Physical) address dyamically.


Address Resolution Protocol cache poisoning or spoofing is the act, by a malicious
host on the LAN, of introducing a spurious IP-to-Ethernet address mapping in
another hostâ€™s ARP cache. The result of ARP cache poisoning is that the IP traffic
intended for one host is diverted to a different host.

A successful ARP spoofing (poisoning) attack allows an attacker to alter routing on a
network, effectively allowing for a man_in_the_middle attack.

This project's goal is to specify what are the vulnerabilities of the ARP protocol and
what kind of Malicias Attacks can be done using the vulnerability and performing
Men_in_the_middle Attack using ARP Spoofing.
